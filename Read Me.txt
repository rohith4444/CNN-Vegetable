### Download data :

I have provided the google drive link which is open to share to every one in the dataset folder.


### Running Code :

I have used googlecolab to run this code it took around 35 for complete execution of .ipynb file.
____I used a path(to my drive) variable to save best check point model.I think u guys have to make change
      before running the code other than that i think remaining is all same. 

If you guys use same then there will be no problem or if you guys use jupyter notebook it is taking 40 mins for each epoch
and that is huge time.
